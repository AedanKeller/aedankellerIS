                <h2 id="risks"> Unintentional Injuries: A Leading Cause of Child Mortality</h2>
                <p><strong>Unintentional injuries are by far the leading cause of death among children in the United States, but here‚Äôs the good news: these accidents are completely preventable!</strong> With just a little awareness and a few simple precautions, we can significantly reduce the risk of harm to our kids. By making small changes and keeping safety at the forefront, we can help protect children and make sure they grow up happy, healthy, and safe.</p>
                
                <h3> The Most Common Types of Unintentional Injuries:</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="icon icon-drowning">üåä</span><strong>Drowning</strong>: The number one cause of injury-related death for kids aged 1 to 4. But with a watchful eye and proper safety measures, like swimming lessons and secure pool fencing, we can keep our little ones safe around water.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon icon-car">üöó</span><strong>Motor Vehicle Accidents</strong>: This is a big one for kids aged 5 to 14. Buckling up, using car seats correctly, and ensuring everyone is in the right seat for their age and size are easy ways to protect children while on the road.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon icon-fall">üè†</span><strong>Falls</strong>: Falls are another leading cause of injury. Whether it's in the home, playground, or out in nature, creating safe spaces to play and being mindful of potential hazards can go a long way in preventing accidents.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon icon-suffocation">üò∑</span><strong>Suffocation</strong>: Especially for babies under 1 year old, suffocation is a concern. A simple step like making sure babies sleep on their backs in a clear crib, free from pillows or blankets, can make all the difference in preventing suffocation.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p><strong>These are simple steps we can all take to create a safer world for our kids.</strong> By staying informed, being proactive, and making safety a priority, we can drastically reduce the risks and ensure our children grow up with the bright futures they deserve. Together, let‚Äôs keep our kids safe, happy, and full of life!</p>
